### Graph
* type of **data structure**
* == Node + Edge (간선)
* Edge can get the weight (가중치)
* Directed graph vs Undirected graph
![그림1](https://github.com/hyun-jin891/hyun-jin891.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/60.PNG?raw=true){: width="600" height="600"}<br>

* Complete graph (완전 그래프)
  * One node should be connected to all of other nodes
  * If the number of nodes is n, the number of edges is n(n-1)/2 (If the graph is directed graph, n(n-1))

* Bipartite graph (이분 그래프)
  * With 2 colors, it can be painted (One node should be painted by different color with neighbor nodes) : 2-colorable graph
    * That is, there should be no cycle between 3 nodes
  * Complete bipartite graph (완전 이분 그래프)
    * Complete graph + Bipartite graph
  * Example Problem

    ~~~
    정점 수가 N, 변의 수가 M인 그래프가 주어집니다. <br>
    각 정점에는 1부터 N까지의 번호가 붙어 있으며, i번째 변은 <br>
    정점 Ai와 정점 Bi를 양방향으로 연결합니다.<br>
    그래프가 이분 그래프인지 판정하는 프로그램을 작성해 주세요.

      N, M = map(int, input().split())
      graph = [[] for i in range(N + 1)]

      for i in range(M):

      * Use "there should be no cycle between 3 nodes"
      * graph[current_node] should not have common elements with graph[next_node] (next_node is the element of graph[current_node])
      * For this, I use "set" data structure with "intersection" method

    * My solution 2

      <br>

      ~~~python
      N, M = map(int, input().split())
      A = [None] * M
      B = [None] * M
      graph = [[] for i in range(N + 1)]

      for i in range(M):
          a, b = map(int, input().split())
          graph[a].append(b)
          graph[b].append(a)
          A[i] = b
          B[i] = a

      color = [0] * (N + 1)

      def DFS(node, color):
          for next_node in graph[node]:
              if color[next_node] == 0:
                  color[next_node] = 3 - color[node]
                  DFS(next_node, color)

      for i in range(1, N + 1):
          if color[i] == 0:
              color[i] = 1
              DFS(i, color)

      flag = True
      for i in range(M):
          if color[A[i]] == color[B[i]]:
              flag = False

      if flag:
          print("Yes")

      * Directly put one color selected from two colors to one node (no color : 0, one color : 1, the other color : 2)
      * 3 - color[node] : try to make bipartite graph
      * If it cannot be bipartite graph, there must be the case that color[A[i]] is equal to color[B[i]]

* Planar graph (평면적 그래프), Plane graph (평면 그래프)
  * Planar graph : Given only several nodes (not edge), it can be called as planar graph if we can draw plane graph
  * Plane graph : All edges cannot be intersected
    * Edge < 3 x node
    * 4-colorable graph (at least 4 color)

* Eulerian graph (오일러 그래프)
  * If we can be back to start node through all of edges (node can be passed by multiple times), it can be called as Eulerian graph

* Tree
  * If we cannot be back to start node (node cannot be passed by multiple times), it can be called as tree
  * Edge = Node - 1

* Regular graph (정규 그래프)
  * All nodes have same degree
  * Degree (차수)
    * The number of edges which are connected to one node

* Directed acyclic graph (유향 비순환 그래프)
  * Directed graph
  * If we cannot be back to start node (node cannot be passed by multiple times), it can be called as acyclic graph

### Representation
* **Adjacency matrix**
  * 2D array
  * **Case 1**: provide 2D information directly
    * Node == 1, Empty == 0
    * [example](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1012)
  * **Case 2**: provide 1D information
    * should convert to 2D information

* Adjacency list
  * In python, 2D lists are used for representing adjacency nodes of each node
  * These lists are used as linked list

* Comparison between matrix and list
  * Adjacency matrix
    * easily use
    * sensitivity for memory as the size of graph is bigger
    * Time Complexity of BFS & DFS
      * For searching neighbor nodes, we should search all of nodes
      * **O(Node<sup>2</sup>)**
  * Adjacency list
    * save the memory
    * hard
    * Time Complexity of BFS & DFS
      * There is no need to search all of nodes for finding neighbor nodes
      * **O(Node + Edge)**
