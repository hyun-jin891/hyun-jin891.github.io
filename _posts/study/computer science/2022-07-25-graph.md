### Graph
* type of **data structure**
* == Node + Edge (간선)
* Edge can get the weight (가중치)
* Directed graph vs Undirected graph

* Complete graph (완전 그래프)
  * One node should be connected to all of other nodes
  * If the number of nodes is n, the number of edges is n(n-1)/2 (If the graph is directed graph, n(n-1))

* Bipartite graph (이분 그래프)
  * With 2 colors, it can be painted (One node should be painted by different color with neighbor nodes) : 2-colorable graph
    * That is, there should be no cycle between 3 nodes
  * Complete bipartite graph (완전 이분 그래프)
    * Complete graph + Bipartite graph
  * Example Problem
  This is the private repository where I can only review my notes<br>

* Planar graph (평면적 그래프), Plane graph (평면 그래프)
  * Planar graph : Given only several nodes (not edge), it can be called as planar graph if we can draw plane graph
  * Plane graph : All edges cannot be intersected
    * Edge < 3 x node
    * 4-colorable graph (at least 4 color)

* Eulerian graph (오일러 그래프)
  * If we can be back to start node through all of edges (node can be passed by multiple times), it can be called as Eulerian graph

* Tree
  * If we cannot be back to start node (node cannot be passed by multiple times), it can be called as tree
  * Edge = Node - 1

* Regular graph (정규 그래프)
  * All nodes have same degree
  * Degree (차수)
    * The number of edges which are connected to one node

* Directed acyclic graph (유향 비순환 그래프)
  * Directed graph
  * If we cannot be back to start node (node cannot be passed by multiple times), it can be called as acyclic graph

### Representation
* **Adjacency matrix**
  * 2D array
  * **Case 1**: provide 2D information directly
    * Node == 1, Empty == 0
    * [example](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1012)
  * **Case 2**: provide 1D information
    * should convert to 2D information

* Adjacency list
  * In python, 2D lists are used for representing adjacency nodes of each node
  * These lists are used as linked list

* Comparison between matrix and list
  * Adjacency matrix
    * easily use
    * sensitivity for memory as the size of graph is bigger
    * Time Complexity of BFS & DFS
      * For searching neighbor nodes, we should search all of nodes
      * **O(Node<sup>2</sup>)**
  * Adjacency list
    * save the memory
    * hard
    * Time Complexity of BFS & DFS
      * There is no need to search all of nodes for finding neighbor nodes
      * **O(Node + Edge)**
