### Graph
* type of **data structure**
* == Node + Edge (간선)
* Directed graph vs Undirected graph

### Representation
* **Adjacency matrix**
  * 2D array
  * **Case 1**: provide 2D information directly
    * Node == 1, Empty == 0
    * [example](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1012)
  * **Case 2**: provide 1D information
    * should convert to 2D information

* Adjacency list
  * In python, 2D lists are used for representing adjacency nodes of each node
  * These lists are used as linked list
  ![그림3](/assets/img/62.png?raw=true){: width="600" height="600"}

* Comparison between matrix and list
  * Adjacency matrix
    * easily use
    * sensitivity for memory as the size of graph is bigger
  * Adjacency list
    * save the memory
    * hard
