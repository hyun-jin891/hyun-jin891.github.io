### Tree
* a kind of Graph
* Node (N) + Edge (N-1)
* hierarchy : no cycle (Only Top → Bottom or Bottom → Top)
* From root (only one) to specific node, ***there is only one path***
* For all of nodes except root node, it has only one parent node
* A specific node can be a root node for **subtree**

### Words
![그림1](https://github.com/hyun-jin891/hyun-jin891.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/140.PNG?raw=true){: width="600" height="600"}<br>
* Root node
* Parent node
* Child node
* **Leaf node** : has no child node
* **Internal node** : node which is not leaf node
* **Sibling nodes** : have same parent node
* **Level** (for a specific node) : the number of nodes while searching from root to specific node (root node : level 0)
* **Height** (for a tree) : maximum level
* **Degree** (for a specific node) : the number of subtrees whose root nodes are child nodes of a specific node
* **Degree of tree** (for a tree) : maximum degree
* **Depth** (for a specific node): From root to a specific node, the number of edges
* **Size** (for a specific node) : 1 (self) + the number of child nodes

### Implementation
~~~python
class Node:
  def __init__(self, data = None):
    self.data = data
    self.child = {}      # dictionary (key == data, value == Node for data)
                        # Based on the situation, list can be used

class Tree:
  def __init__(self, node):
    self.root = node

  # various method can be implemented
~~~
* Because tree is also graph, it can be also implemented by Adjacency matrix or Adjacency list

### Binary Tree
* Degree of all nodes <= 2
* **Binary Search Tree**
  * all nodes of one node's left-subtree <= one node <= all nodes of one node's right-subtree
* Full Binary Tree : All internal nodes have 2 child nodes
* Perfect Binary Tree : Depth of all leaf nodes has same value
* Complete Binary Tree : All nodes have 2 child nodes except for nodes of last level (They may have only left-child node or 2 child nodes)
* Balanced Binary Tree : Difference between one leaf node's depth and others' depth is at most 1

### Implementation for Binary Tree
~~~python
class Node:
  def __init__(self, data = None):
    self.data = data
    self.left = None
    self.right = None

class BinaryTree:
  def __init__(self, node):
    self.root = node

  # various method can be implemented
~~~

* Because tree is also graph, it can be also implemented by Adjacency matrix or Adjacency list

### Search for Tree
* method 1 : **BFS**<br>

~~~python

from collections import deque

class Node:
  def __init__(self, data = None):
    self.data = data
    self.child = []

class Tree:
  def __init__(self, node):
    self.root = node

def BFS(tree):
  visited = []
  need_visit = deque()
  need_visit.append(tree.root)

  while need_visit:
    node = need_visit.popleft()
    print(node.data)
    visited.append(node)

    for child in node.child:
      if child not in visited:
        need_visit.append(child)
~~~

* method 2 : **DFS**
  * Use recursion
  * PreOrder : Root → Left → Right (A, B, D, E, C, F)
  * InOrder : Left → Root → Right (D, B, E, A, C, F)
  * PostOrder : Left → Right → Root (D, E, B, F, C, A)

~~~python
class Node:
  def __init__(self, data = None):
    self.data = data
    self.left = None
    self.right = None

  def preOrder(self, root_node):
    if root_node == None:
      return
    print(root_node.data)
    preOrder(root_node.left)
    preOrder(root_node.right)  

  def inOrder(self, root_node):
    if root_node == None:
      return

    inOrder(root_node.left)
    print(root_node.data)
    inOrder(root_node.right)

  def postOrder(self, root_node):
    if root_node == None:
      return

    postOrder(root_node.left)
    postOrder(root_node.right)
    print(root_node.data)
~~~
