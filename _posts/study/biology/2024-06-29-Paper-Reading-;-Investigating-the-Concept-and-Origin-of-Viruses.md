## Paper Reading; Investigating the Concept and Origin of Viruses

## Purpose of Paper
* Find the definition of viruses
* Suggest the origin of viruses

## Definition of Viruses
* It is just only "Virions"?
  * Virions == inert viral particles with nucleic acid that can cause host cells to be infected
  * "Viruses" should jump from "Virions" to "Virions Factory"
    * That is, "Viruses" should involve all the steps of viruses' life cycle
* Some explain that "Viruses" are tiny biological entities or have no metabolism-related gene (non-living)
  * They are rejected because of Giant Viruses
  * Giant Viruses
    * bigger than many parasitic cells
    * have some metabolic genes expressed in the infected cells
* All parts (particle + genome) of virions are not always necessary for defining "Viruses"
  * Case 1: Lack of Particle Parts
    * Plasmid: It may be a virus precursor
    * Viroid: There is no protein coat, It consists of short circular RNA, The host is a vascular plant
  * Case 2: Lack of Genome for Replicating Themselves
    * Polydnaviruses
      * Their genome is dispersed within the genome of parasitoid wasps (기생말벌)
      * They don't have any genes for replicating themselves because they replicate by expressing their genes through the parasitoid wasps' translation system
      * They are made only in the part of parasitoid wasps' ovary
      * When the parasitoid wasps inject their eggs into the caterpillar, polydnaviruses are injected together
      * They protect the eggs from the immune system of the caterpillar
        * This is why polydnaviruses are called "gene delivery vectors"
      * That is, the relationship between the viruses and parasitoid wasps is symbiosis
  * Consequently, the definition of "Viruses" doesn't need to involve the complete virions
* Consequently, the paper suggests that the definition of "Viruses" should involve
  * Parasitism
  * Dissemination and Propagation of genome with metabolically inert structure

## Origin of Viruses
* In the case of "Virus-mediated Parasitism", it starts to happen after the cells begin to exist
  * It is different from the question "When did viruses start to exist"
* so, when did "Viruses" start to exist?
* Krupovic's Model
  * Viral nucleic acid starts to show in the pre-cellular world
  * After the cells begin to exist, virions start to show + parasitism happens
  * This model explains why the giant viruses are getting bigger
    * Because they capture the genes of the host cells
* This paper rejects Krupovic's Model
  * Viral genetic diversity can be explained through the studies of ancient cells before we reach the pre-cell world
  * In the case of most parasitism and endosymbiosis, their genomes are getting smaller as they depend on their host more
    * The model's explanation for the giant cell is false
* This paper suggests the origin of "Viruses"
  * The viruses start to exist when the ancient cell (before LUCA) exists
  * These pre-LUCA ancient cells are RNA cells
  * **LUCA** (Last Universal Common Ancestor)
    * last common ancestor before releasing 3 domains (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryotes)  
  * Hypothesis A
